# GProxy and AwsAd
The projects include two programs, AwsAd and GProxy.

#### AwsAd
Generates STS Tokens based on SAML Assertion from Azure AD.
The credentials are stored in the AWS credentials files, such that it can be used by the aws cli, boto3, etc.
Multiple profiles are supported, giving the ability to use multiple AWS accounts.
Config for the profiles are stored in the AWS config file.

#### GProxy
Sets up an ssh local forward for the DNB bitbucket domain.
The forward is through a secure server, where the AzureAD login is used to authenticate.
* Automatically authenticates.
* Uses built in ssh.
* Auto configuration of ssh config.

#### Azure Active Directory 
* All MFA methods supported.
* Cookies are stored between sessions to support faster authentications, and less need of supplying password.
* Shared state between gproxy and awsad.

## Installation
Recommended: With password management (stores password in OS keystore).

    $ pip3 install "git+https://github.com/YesperP/dnb-ad-utils.git#egg=dnb-ad-utils [keyring]"

Minimal:

    $ pip3 install git+https://github.com/YesperP/dnb-ad-utils.git

Local:

    $ cd <project_dir>
    $ pip3 install .

## Requirements
* Python 3.7+

## Usage
There is one command for each of AwsAd and GProxy, with help files for each,
 together with help for subcommands:
    
    $ gproxy -h
    $ awsad -h
    $ awsad login -h

Also, both can be used directly from code. Particularly useful is AwsAd.

    import boto3
    from dnbutils.awsad import AwsAd
    AwsAd("<your-profile>").login_if_invalid_credentials().setup_default_boto3_session(region_name="eu-west-1")
    boto3.client("dynamodb").do_something()


## Configuration

Both GProxy and AwsAd needs some basic configuration before running, respectively:

    $ gproxy configure
    $ awsad configure [-p <profile>]

User and Password management for ActiveDirectory are shared between the two programs. 

## GProxy Advanced
GProxy relies on OpenSSH on your local machine, allowing for customization.

#### GProxy Config
The following entry is required in the ssh config. Configuration will check for its existence, and
will aid in creating/changing it.

    Host git.tech-01.net
        Hostname XXXX  # Required. Default value: localhost
        Port XXXX  # Required. Default value: 9000
        StrictHostKeyChecking XX  # Optional. Default value: no

You may change this entry as you please (for instance, if the default port is already in use).
GProxy will pull the latest hostname and port as in the config.

#### GProxy through a proxy (experimental)
If you are on a network not permitting SSH access or want to mask your traffic 
(for instance using a tool like STunnel), you may also want to change where GProxy connects.
GProxy will connect to 'gitproxy.ccoe.cloud:443'. But since OpenSSH is used,
you may create an entry in your ssh config which overrides this.

    Host gitproxy.ccoe.cloud
        Hostname <your_proxy_host>
        Port <your_proxy_port>
